# Assignment 0: Programming with Python

Welcome to the programming portion of the assignment! Each assignment throughout the semester will have a written portion and a programming portion. We will be using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true), so if you have never used it before, take a quick look through this introduction: [Working with Google Colab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w6yEKKC7hLb9Wus9fMoOo1KpacYew2bOb3LjTllaGaE/edit?usp=sharing).



We'll also be programming in Python, which we will assume a basic familiarity with. Python has fantastic community support and we'll be using numerous packages for machine learning (ML) tasks. In this assignment, we're going to get familiar with [NumPy](https://numpy.org), a data handling library [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and one of the foundational building blocks of many ML libraries, and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org), which is used to programmatically construct graphs.



### Learning Objectives

1. Gain familiarity with the NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib packages

2. Practice using Google Colab, Python, and Jupyter Notebooks



If you have any issues with the packages, feel free to reference the docs for each package ([numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/contents.html)).
