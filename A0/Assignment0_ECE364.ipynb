Each assignment throughout the semester will have a written portion and a programming portion.

Python has fantastic community support and we'll be using numerous packages for machine learning (ML) tasks. In this assignment, we're going to get familiar with [NumPy](https://numpy.org), a data handling library [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and one of the foundational building blocks of many ML libraries, and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org), which is used to programmatically construct graphs.\n","\n","### Learning Objectives\n","1. Gain familiarity with the NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib packages\n","2. Practice using Google Colab, Python, and Jupyter Notebooks\n","\n","If you have any issues with the packages, feel free to reference the docs for each package ([numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/1.19/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/contents.html)). \n","\n","**If you get stuck, please come to office hours, review the optional precept, or post on Canvas. We're here to help you succeed!**\n","\n","Excited? Let's get started!\n","\n","### Setting up the environment\n","Below we're going to download the necessary packages, copy the datasets we'll be using (if required), and import the necessary packages. \n","\n","Please do not download or import any additional packages without first consulting the course staff.
